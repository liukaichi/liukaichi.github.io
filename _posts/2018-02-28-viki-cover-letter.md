There are moments in my life where my heart is set racing even when I'm sitting still: envisioning my next beatboxing routine, reliving my first jiu-jitsu match, or finally piecing together a impactful solution with my app. As I've followed through with these moments, they've become some of my most meaningful experiences to me. As cheesy as it sounds, thinking of the prospect of working with Viki has set my heart racing. I feel that my experience and passion for coding user-centered apps will make me a great fit for this job.

Early in my university days, I discovered that I had a passion for UX. I loved creating apps that <i>empower</i> users through design. My degree in computer science taught me design patterns, algorithms, and strategies to help create smart, maintainable code. But more than that, I've been obsessed with ensuring whatever I create feels like it was made especially for the user.

Since then, I've been able to hone my technical and design skills through my work as a freelance mobile developer. I've worked on multiple complex projects from start to finish, including UX/UI design, both cross-platform and native development, and publishing. I've been able to familiarize myself with a lot of bugs, nuances, and flaws that come in each of these steps. I've loved working with different developers and stakeholders as a team to create amazing products. Doing so has trained me to communicate my ideas more clearly and write cleaner code. These well-rounded experiences have allowed me to see the bigger picture when developing and designing. I believe the skills I've developed will make a great contribution as a member of Viki.

I hope we'll be able to meet soon. My resum√© is down below, and this website is actually my portfolio, so feel free to <a  target="\_blank" href="/">take a look around</a>. Keep scrolling down for my contact info. If you have any questions for me, feel free to ask! Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Justin Liu
