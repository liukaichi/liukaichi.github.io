BandLab is an amazing app. I'm continually amazed at what powerful software BandLab offers users for free. Being a big fan of BandLab, I conducted a case study which resulted a few minor changes to navigation that have proven to be up to 88% faster for your new users. You can find this <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://liukaichi.github.io/files/BandLab-Case-Study.pdf">case study here</a>. And if you don't feel like reading the whole thing, you can watch <a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/BandLab-Video-Case-Study-res">my video summary here</a>. I would love to continue to discuss the ideas presented in the case study, as well as how I could contribute my skills as a musician and UX designer to join BandLab in inspiring its next million users.

I have strong musical experiences from young, which will help me both understand the product and talk more fluidly while working with others. I worked closely with a couple of audio engineers in college and was actually aiming to become one. In the end, I found that besides my love for music, I also loved creating apps that are designed to empower users.

My degree in computer science taught me how much I love working in a team. Many courses grouped us in teams to create affinity diagrams, contextual inquiry, low/high fidelity prototypes, and usability testing to create meaningful user experiences. Two of these courses ranked the end user experience out of six groups; My group ranked 1st and 2nd for these courses.

Since my degree, my freelance projects have given me the pleasure of working with different users, developers and stakeholders. Doing so has trained me to communicate my ideas more clearly and create meaningful wireframes, mockups, and testing methods. With these well-rounded experiences, I believe I can make a great contribution as a member of BandLab.

I hope we'll be able to meet soon. My resum√© is down below, and this website is actually my portfolio, so feel free to <a  target="_blank" href="/">take a look around</a>. Keep scrolling down for my contact info. If you have any questions for me, feel free to ask! Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Justin Liu
