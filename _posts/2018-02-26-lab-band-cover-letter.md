There are moments in my life where my heart is set racing even when I'm sitting still: envisioning my next beatboxing routine, reliving my first jiu-jitsu match, or finally piecing together a impactful solution with my app. As I've followed through with these moments, they've become some of my most meaningful experiences to me. As cheesy as it sounds, thinking of the prospect of working with BandLab has set my heart racing. I feel that my experience and passion for music will make me a great fit for this job.

I have strong musical experiences, which will help me both understand the product and talk more fluidly while working with others. I worked closely with a couple of audio engineers in college and actually was aiming to become one. In the end, I found that besides my love for music, I also loved creating apps that are designed to empower users. My degree in computer science taught me design patterns, algorithms, and strategies to help create smart, maintainable code.

Since then, I've been able to hone my technical skills through my work as a freelance Android developer. I've worked on multiple projects from start to finish, including design, implementation, and publishing. I've been able to familiarize myself with a lot of bugs, nuances, and flaws that come in each of these steps. I've loved working with different developers and stakeholders with each project. Doing so has trained me to communicate my ideas more clearly and write more understandable code. With these well-rounded experiences, I believe I can make a great contribution as a member of BandLab.

I hope we'll be able to meet soon. My resum√© is down below, and this website is actually my portfolio, so feel free to <a  target="_blank" href="/">take a look around</a>. Keep scrolling down for my contact info. If you have any questions for me, feel free to ask! Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Justin Liu
