When introduced to the idea about a self-driving car, many people's first reaction (especially in the older generation) is fear and skepticism. Will it keep me and my loved ones safe? How will I know the car will make the right decisions? As a User Experience Designer, this problem has deep meaning to me because it requires a beautiful balance between company goals and user needs. If autonomous vehicles seem unsafe or untrustworthy, it won't matter how great the product actually is -- it won't be used. I would love to discuss how I could contribute my skills as a UX designer to help nuTonomy reach out to a tentative community as it ventures out to a new age of technology.

My degree in computer science made me realize how much I love working in a team. Many courses grouped us in teams to create affinity diagrams, contextual inquiry, low/high fidelity prototypes, and usability testing to create meaningful user experiences. For two semesters, I took the opportunity to lead a group in my class to create two unique user experiences. These prototypes ranked 1st and 2nd out of 6 total groups.

Since my degree, my freelance projects have given me the pleasure of working with different users, developers and stakeholders. Doing so has trained me to communicate my ideas more clearly and create meaningful wireframes, mockups, and testing methods. With these experiences, I believe I can make a great contribution as a member of nuTonomy. If I receive the pleasure of joining, I would look to continue refining my skills, especially to learn from a project that lasts a longer period of time.

I hope we'll be able to meet soon. My resum√© is down below, and this website is actually my portfolio, so feel free to <a  target="_blank" href="/">take a look around</a>. Keep scrolling down for my contact info. If you have any questions for me, feel free to ask! Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Justin Liu
